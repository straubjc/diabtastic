#RWD Template

##Description


This template is to be used as a starting point for developing responsive web designs. This is for front end developers who have a good understanding of how to build a site, and just prefer a starting point. Resize the demo on a computer to see the nav change, or just check it out on your mobile device.


##Demo

##Why is it Awesome?

- Add Multi-Level Nav Dropdowns with an unordered list.
- Automatically creates off-canvas mobile nav for small screens
- Includes Font Awesome 4
- Ready for many various responsive element types
- The mobile navigation animation uses CSS3 so it's silky smooth.
- Unlike other templates/boilerplates, it doesn't force you to use any particular layout method besides an unordered list for the navigation. Code how you want to!
- FREE for personal, professional, or other projects. Just don't attempt to resell this as-is

##Requirements

- The responsive portions of this website require a recent version of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or Opera. IE9+ should be mostly supported.(Old versions of IE should still work, but will be missing out on some of the responsive features.)
- The site must be built fluidly. (does not require horizontal scrollbars).
- In mobile view, the page content should preferably be longer than the navigation sidebar for best effect.

##Licensing
Free to use & abuse, although respect the licenses of the individuals listed in the credits section below.
